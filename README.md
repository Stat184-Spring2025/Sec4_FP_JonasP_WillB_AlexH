# Student Lifestyle Factors and their Effects

The goal of our repo is to determine the impact of time spent doing certain kinds of activities and stress has on a students cumulative GPA. We will also analyse how factors such as a students academic major effects there mental health.


## Overview
Our project looks at the variables of time spent studying, sleeping, being social, doing physical activity, extracurricular activities, and a students reported level of stress, and see if any of them have a strong relation on the resulting cumulative GPA of a given student. To acomplish this we generated a serious of data visualations that helped us get a better understanding of of how these factors effect student well being. 


### Interesting Insight

This is an example of one of the visualizations we created for this project. From it we are able to determine what student academic majors can be considerd "higher stress". This is very useful insight because it tells us how a students academic major impacts there mental health. Universities could then use this information to taylor suport serveices to these higher stress majors.
